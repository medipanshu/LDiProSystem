# Gas Cylinder Weight Monitoring System

## Overview
This project focuses on monitoring the usage of LPG gas in a cylinder by utilizing a load cell interfaced with an Arduino. The system records real-time weight data, analyzes consumption patterns, and provides insights into the rate of gas consumption at different times of the day.

## Components and Dependencies
1. **Arduino Setup:**
    - Data is read from the load cell (AtoD converter) using the Arduino.
    - The required library for interfacing with the load cell is 'HX711_ADC.' If not already present in your Arduino IDE, you can download it from the 'HX711_ADC' folder.

2. **Data Transmission:**
    - The Arduino sends the load cell data to the USB port.

3. **Python Integration:**
    - Stream data is read from the serial (USB port) using the Python Serial library.

## Demo Data
- 'Final_data1.xlsx' provides a small demonstration of reading data at 10-second intervals from a 1000g water container.
- Note: Due to potential hardware variations, there might be a margin of error of Â±50.

## Project Description
The system is designed to monitor the consumption of LPG gas in a cylinder with an initial weight of 30 kg. As gas is used, there is a continuous decrease in weight. The project aims to measure gas consumption every 10 seconds, allowing for a detailed analysis of consumption patterns throughout the day, such as during breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

## Data Analysis and Future Enhancements
1. **Usage Patterns:**
    - Analyzing data collected over 15 minutes (90 data points) to understand usage patterns.
  
2. **Linear Regression Model:**
    - Predicting the time to finish a specific amount of gas using a linear regression model.
  
3. **Future Enhancements:**
    - Ongoing efforts to enhance project reliability through improved data analysis.
    - Exploring advanced data analysis techniques for more accurate results.

## Notes
- It's essential to consider hardware variations that may introduce a margin of error in the weight measurements (+50 or -50).
- Continuous improvements and refinements are part of our ongoing project development.

We encourage contributions and feedback to make this Gas Cylinder Weight Monitoring System more robust and insightful.
